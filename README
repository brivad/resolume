Resolume Composition Parser

This app parse a ResolumeÂ® composition file (.avc) (which is an XML file)

Opening a composition:

  composition = ResolumeComposition.new("filename.avc")

printing clips info

  composition.clips_info
  
to copy all clips in a given directory

  copy_clips(dir)
  
  dir must be absolute path with r/w access
  
  a new composition is saved with the new paths inside
  
NOTES:
at the moment it only works with video clips (no audio clipsor infos are touched) this can create an inconsistent avc file
